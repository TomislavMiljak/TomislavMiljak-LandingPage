        <p>Respected future employers and colleagues,</p>
        <p>I am writing these few lines alongside my curriculum vitae and application in an attempt to better clarify my UNIQUE STANDING POSITION, to help you decide on my application, and also to filter out early those of you whose values and priorities don't stand in line with my USP.
        I apologize that my shortest storyline doesn't fit into one A4 sheet, and I encourage all of you who exclusively expect cover letters to fit one A4 sheet to kindly stop reading here, and not continue losing your time. Thank you for your effort and consideration nevertheless!</p>
        <p>Despite my short storyline on my unique standing point below (hm, would it really prove to be that unique?), I do want to stress out that I want to progress with coding, learn more, be successful, and land a paid working position. I want to become a valuable employee in the company or organisation that would also be right for me, as I would be right for them, in the long run, and I want to become a contributing member to the society.</p>
        <p>Continuing with my introduction, as my wife got a once in a lifetime job opportunity to move to Berlin in February 2023, for next four years, till 2027., we decided to move to Berlin as a family with our kindergarten-aged son. I left the steady kindergarten psychologist – expert associate job in Croatia after more than ten working years, hoping my work experience and English language full professional proficiency would be enough for me to find a job in Germany sooner rather than later. On top of that, our son wasn't inclined to go to school for at least next two and a half years at the time, so we'd hoped he'd be able to learn German in the meantime enough to be ready for school. Finally, my wife's four years paycheck in Germany would prove to be roughly as my sixteen years salary in Croatia!</p>
        <p>After I couldn't manage to find a job in Germany during the first half of 2023. as a psychologist without the highest German language working proficiency, and as I'd learned that in German preschool system there actually are no kindergarten psychologist - expert associate positions equivalent to those in Croatia, I have decided to try and delve into Web Development in May 2023. for the first time, at 40 years of age with a previously completely clean IT sheet – no prior experience nor any interest in it whatsoever.</p>
        <p>It seemed at the time as a fair opportunity to learn a new and valued skillset with one main thought in mind, invest an initial 14 months without a paycheck, to get in the position from which I'd believed I might easily earn a paycheck and land a job to be able to provide for my family. That was my main motivation for the decision to try IT. Not love nor interest in IT, rather perceived likeliness to subsequently find a suitable paid working position. So I went to a big job fair organised in Berlin in the end of March 2023. by the German Wirtschaftskammer, where I came under the impression after a conversation with the recruiter person from the company I was later in contact with and subsequently continued my Web Dev learning path with, that learning coding/programming from scratch, and delving into IT world might be a legitimate perspective, and that I would after an intensive 14 months training with the company program in fact be equipped with sufficient skillset to get a paid position in the IT world.</p>
        <p>At this moment, having almost finished the 14 months training for Web Developer, having met and being lucky to work with and alongside many motivated and inspiring colleagues who practically live, breathe, eat and sleep the IT attitude on a daily basis, I can say with a firm attitude of my own that coding, programming, IT is really not suitable for just anybody, nor would everybody find it fun, motivating or stimulating, especially those who haven't got a keen interest in it or established a deeper intrinsic motivation for it. 
        All the invested time and effort during the past 13+ months (and invest I did, with great dedication along the way), didn't move me much away from my initial viewpoint of wondering how could someone in the right frame of mind enjoy spending the best time of their days and lives sitting in front of their computers. Yes, I must admit my experience during the last year did reveal to me how much possibilities could open if a person dedicates the best of their efforts and resources and willpower to it, and yes, I do believe a dedicated person can really achieve a lot with a computer and a good internet connection, no doubt.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, as after 13+ months of dedicated investing the best of MY days, health, effort, willpower to learning Web Dev I realise I'm not equipped enough to easily land a paid position, but I rather realise I have to invest even much much much more resources, without any paycheck on a horizon. Consequently, I do have to admit I feel greatly disappointed with my previous decision to try Web Dev, and wonder if it might have been a huge mistake for me. I really feel a genuine IMPOSTER SYNDROME and stuck up to my neck with only a raw basis of skillset that seems barely sufficient in the highly competitive market, at least to me currently.</p>
        <p>To be perfectly honest, no, I don't feel coding is fun at all, at least not for me. For me it feels predominately as big strain, or a headache. And I only feel miserable being inclined to do it without alternatives.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, as I don't have many better options, unfortunately, I will do my best to stick with the activities I've already grown considerable aversion towards. </p>
        <p>I hope that with time and continued effort I would learn to code better and easier, so it would take less time to come up with solutions to the coming problems. </p>
        <p>Should I find no other paid positions, I will try to freelance and focus on music and psychology as content strongpoints to further concentrate and carve my coding skills around.</p>
        <p>MY MAIN TAKE-AWAY for all of you employers, and especially those who did read through this is: </p>
        <p>Despite my short storyline on my unique standing point above (hm, did it really prove to be that unique?), I do want to stress out once more that I am very motivated to progress with coding, learn more, be successful, and land a paid working position.</p>
        <p>Please just don't expect to see much enthusiasm from me on the interview. I'm realistic about my position and going through a really hard time with it, but I am also very aware that hard work and dedication, fresh ideas and interest get employers interested in employees, and I would do my best to offer those and show appreciation.</p>
        <p>I do want to become a valuable employee in the company or organisation that would also be right for me, as I would be right for them, in the long run, and I want to become a contributing member to the society.</p>
        <p>I don't believe I would ever grow liking coding, but I'm willing to do my best at getting much better at it.</p>
        <p>I firmly believe job applications are a two way street in terms on making the right picks on both ends, employer and employee and it is very important for me to filter out any employers that wouldn't find me a valuable asset for their team in the future.</p>
        <p>I hope I might be a good worker for you though:</p>
        <p>1. if you highly value straightforwardness, honesty, open-mindedness, dilligence and considerable soft-skills,</p>
        <p>2. if you are looking for a worker who would appreciate your trust with letting him learn from the beginning at own pace, and who would try his best to meet your trust with continued effort,</p>
        <p>3. if you can help me get acquainted with your tech stack,</p>
        <p>4. if you are offering a learning position, that can turn into a permanent position,</p>
        <p>5. if my English language professional proficiency would suffice,</p>
        <p>6. I don't expect any higher than 24k yearly salary for the beginning, with perspective to grow.</p>
        <p>I am really looking forward to getting back from all of you who find the above lines reasonable, and who can see a human being with a UNIQUE STANDING POSITION of PERSONAL INTEGRITY and with that in mind could still see me as a valuable employee. I will be honoured to be moving forward the application process with you, and would do my best to meet your job requirements and needs, as long as they are in reasonable accordance with the above.</p>
        <p>I most sincerely thank all of you who have read this letter for their time and good will, and wish you all the best with your future endeavours. </p>
        <p>Best greetings!</p>
        <p>Tomislav Miljak</p></b>
